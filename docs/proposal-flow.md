# Proposal Flow Documentation

This document defines the complete proposal workflow for the influencer marketplace platform.

---

## Overview

The proposal workflow manages the lifecycle of a collaboration from initial proposal to completion. Instead of a single linear status, **we use 3 parallel status tracks** that are always visible independently:

1. **Proposal Status** - Tracks proposal negotiation and agreement
2. **Payment Status** - Tracks payment milestones (advance and remaining)
3. **Work Status** - Tracks work progress and review

This approach allows clear visibility into each aspect of the collaboration independently.

## Status Model: 3 Parallel Tracks

### Track 1: Proposal Status

| Status | Description | Who Acts Next |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `sent` | Proposal created and sent to influencer | Influencer |
| `accepted` | Influencer accepted the proposal | Promoter |
| `edited` | Proposal edited by promoter, awaiting influencer decision | Influencer |
| `declined` | Proposal declined by influencer (reopenable via edit/resend) | Promoter |
| `closed` | Proposal closed by promoter before acceptance | - |

**Transitions:**
- `sent` → `accepted` (influencer accepts)
- `sent` → `declined` (influencer declines)
- `accepted` → `edited` (promoter edits proposal terms; influencer must respond)
- `declined` → `edited` (promoter edits/resends after decline)
- `edited` → `accepted` (influencer accepts updated proposal)
- `edited` → `declined` (influencer declines updated proposal)
- `sent` → `closed` (promoter closes before influencer accepts)
- `edited` → `closed` (promoter closes instead of resending)

**Important Behaviors:**
- **Influencer decision:** Influencer decision is always `accepted` or `declined`.
- **Decline reason:** Decline requires a reason (e.g. not interested, needs changes, budget mismatch).
- **Promoter edits:** Any promoter edit after `accepted` moves proposal to `edited` for influencer to re-decide.
- **Payment independence:** If a proposal is edited after payment starts, payment/work can continue as agreed by both parties (or escalate via dispute).

### Track 2: Payment Status

| Status | Description | Who Acts Next |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `not_started` | No payment initiated yet | Promoter |
| `pending_advance` | Waiting for advance payment (non-escrow) | Promoter |
| `pending_escrow` | Waiting for full escrow funding (escrow mode) | Promoter |
| `advance_paid` | Advance payment completed/released | Promoter |
| `pending_milestone` | Waiting for milestone payment (optional) | Promoter |
| `milestone_paid` | Milestone payment completed (optional) | Promoter |
| `pending_remaining` | Waiting for remaining payment | Promoter |
| `fully_paid` | All payments completed | - |

**Transitions:**

#### Non-Escrow Flow (`paymentMode: 'none'` or `'platform'`)
- `not_started` → `pending_advance` (proposal accepted, influencer paid platform fee)
- `pending_advance` → `advance_paid` (promoter pays advance manually + uploads transaction details)
- `advance_paid` → `pending_milestone` (optional: if milestone payments configured)
- `pending_milestone` → `milestone_paid` (promoter pays milestone)
- `milestone_paid` → `pending_milestone` (more milestones) OR `pending_remaining` (all milestones done)
- `advance_paid` → `pending_remaining` (if no milestones, work approved)
- `pending_remaining` → `fully_paid` (promoter pays remaining manually + uploads details)

#### Escrow Flow (`paymentMode: 'escrow'`)
- `not_started` → `pending_escrow` (proposal accepted, influencer paid platform fee)
- `pending_escrow` → `advance_paid` (promoter funds full escrow → system automatically releases advance immediately)
- `advance_paid` → `pending_milestone` (optional: if milestone payments configured)
- `pending_milestone` → `milestone_paid` (system releases milestone from escrow)
- `milestone_paid` → `pending_milestone` (more milestones) OR `pending_remaining` (all milestones done)
- `advance_paid` → `pending_remaining` (if no milestones, work approved)
- `pending_remaining` → `fully_paid` (system automatically releases remaining from escrow)

**Payment Mode Rules:**
- `paymentMode` can only be changed when Payment Status is `not_started`, `pending_advance`, or `pending_escrow`
- Once payment is initiated (advance paid or escrow funded), `paymentMode` is locked
- For non-escrow payments, promoter manually marks as paid and uploads proof (screenshot, transaction ID, etc.)

### Track 3: Work Status

| Status | Description | Who Acts Next |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `not_started` | Work not yet started | Influencer |
| `in_progress` | Actively working on deliverables | Influencer |
| `revision_requested` | Promoter requested revisions (stay in review) | Influencer |
| `submitted` | Work submitted, awaiting promoter review | Promoter |
| `approved` | Work approved by promoter | - |
| `disputed` | Dispute raised, admin intervention | Admin |

**Transitions:**
- `not_started` → `in_progress` (advance paid, influencer starts work)
- `in_progress` → `submitted` (influencer submits work at 100%)
- `submitted` → `revision_requested` (promoter requests changes)
- `revision_requested` → `submitted` (influencer resubmits)
- `submitted` → `approved` (promoter approves work)

---

## Overall Proposal State

The overall proposal state is derived from combining all 3 tracks:

| Overall State | Proposal Status | Payment Status | Work Status |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `pending` | `sent` | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| `awaiting_influencer` | `sent` OR `edited` | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| `awaiting_payment` | `accepted` | `pending_advance` OR `pending_escrow` | `not_started` |
| `in_progress` | `accepted` OR `edited` | `advance_paid` OR `milestone_paid` | `in_progress` |
| `in_review` | `accepted` OR `edited` | `advance_paid` OR `milestone_paid` | `submitted` OR `revision_requested` |
| `completed` | Any | `fully_paid` | `approved` |
| `closed` | `closed` | Any | Any |
| `declined` | `declined` | Any | Any |
| `disputed` | Any | Any | `disputed` |

**Completion Condition:**
A proposal is marked as **`completed`** only when ALL 3 tracks reach their final state:
- Proposal Status: Any (proposal agreement is independent once work is complete)
- Payment Status: `fully_paid`
- Work Status: `approved`

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Proposal Negotiation

**Step 1: Promoter creates and sends proposal**
- Creates proposal with title, description, requirements, deliverables
- **Proposal Status:** `sent`
- **Payment Status:** `not_started`
- **Work Status:** `not_started`

**Step 2: Influencer receives proposal**
- Options:
  - **Decline** → Proposal Status: `declined`
  - **Accept** → Proposal Status: `accepted`

**Step 3: Changes after accept (optional)**
- Both parties can discuss in chat.
- If promoter edits proposal terms after acceptance:
  - Proposal Status: `accepted` → `edited`
  - Influencer must either accept updated proposal (→ `accepted`) or decline (→ `declined`)
- If influencer declines, promoter can edit/resend:
  - Proposal Status: `declined` → `edited`

### Phase 2: Payment

**Trigger:** Proposal Status = `accepted`

**Step 1: Influencer pays platform fee**
- Influencer pays ₹49 + GST
- Payment Status moves from `not_started`

**Step 2: Promoter selects payment mode and pays**

#### Option A: Record-Only (`paymentMode: 'none'`)
- No advance required
- **Payment Status:** `not_started` → `fully_paid` (promoter marks as complete, uploads proof if needed)
- Work can start immediately
- All payment happens offline

#### Option B: Platform Payment with Advance (`paymentMode: 'platform'`)
- **Payment Status:** `not_started` → `pending_advance` → `advance_paid`
- Promoter pays advance amount manually
- Promoter uploads transaction details (screenshot, UPI ref, etc.)
- Influencer can start work after advance confirmed

#### Option C: Escrow (`paymentMode: 'escrow'`)
- **Payment Status:** `not_started` → `pending_escrow` → `advance_paid`
- Promoter pays full amount + escrow fee + GST to escrow
- System automatically releases advance immediately
- Remaining amount held in escrow until work approved

**Payment Mode Lock:**
- `paymentMode` can only be changed when Payment Status is `not_started`, `pending_advance`, or `pending_escrow`
- Once payment reaches `advance_paid`, payment mode is locked

### Phase 3: Work Execution

**Trigger:** Payment Status = `advance_paid` OR `fully_paid` (record-only)

**Step 1: Influencer starts work**
- **Work Status:** `not_started` → `in_progress`
- Influencer updates progress percentage (0-100%)
- Uploads drafts/proofs

**Step 2: Influencer submits work**
- At 100% completion, submit for review
- **Work Status:** `in_progress` → `submitted`

**Step 3: Promoter reviews work**
- Promoter reviews submitted work
- Options:
  - **Approve** → Work Status: `approved`
  - **Request revisions** → Work Status: `revision_requested`

**Step 4: Revisions (if needed)**
- Influencer makes requested changes
- Resubmits work
- **Work Status:** `revision_requested` → `submitted`
- Loop continues until approved

### Phase 4: Final Payment

**Trigger:** Work Status = `approved`

**Step 1: Promoter pays remaining amount**

#### For Non-Escrow (`paymentMode: 'none'` or `'platform'`)
- Promoter pays remaining balance manually
- Uploads transaction details (screenshot, UPI ref, etc.)
- **Payment Status:** `advance_paid` → `pending_remaining` → `fully_paid`

#### For Escrow (`paymentMode: 'escrow'`)
- System automatically releases remaining amount from escrow
- **Payment Status:** `advance_paid` → `fully_paid` (automatic, no manual step)

**Step 2: Completion**
- All 3 tracks reach final state:
  - Proposal Status: `agreed`
  - Payment Status: `fully_paid`
  - Work Status: `approved`
- Overall proposal state becomes `completed`
- Generate invoices/documents
- Both parties can leave reviews

## Change Request Workflow

### Proposal Changes

**When:** Any time during discussion or after agreement

**Who:** Primarily Promoter, Influencer can only suggest via chat

**Process:**

#### During Discussion (`proposalStatus: discussing`)
1. Promoter edits proposal (amount, deliverables, requirements, etc.)
2. **Proposal Status:** `discussing` → `changes_requested`
3. Influencer notified via notification + chat
4. Influencer reviews changes:
   - **Approve** → Proposal Status: `agreed`
   - **Reject/Counter** → Proposal Status: `discussing` (continue negotiating)

#### After Agreement (`proposalStatus: agreed`)
1. Promoter edits proposal (even though influencer already agreed)
2. **Proposal Status:** `agreed` → `changes_requested`
3. Influencer notified that promoter made changes to agreed proposal
4. Influencer must re-approve:
   - **Approve** → Proposal Status: `agreed`
   - **Reject** → Proposal Status: `discussing` (renegotiate)
   - **Dispute** → Work Status: `disputed` (if unreasonable changes)

### Work Revision Requests (During Review)

**When:** Work Status = `submitted`

**Who:** Promoter

**Process:**
1. Promoter requests revisions with specific feedback
2. **Work Status:** `submitted` → `revision_requested`
3. Influencer makes changes and resubmits
4. **Work Status:** `revision_requested` → `submitted`
5. Promoter reviews again (can loop multiple times)

---

## Dispute Handling

### When Can Disputes Be Raised?

Disputes can be raised during:
- **Work in progress:** Disagreement on deliverables, timeline, etc.
- **Work review:** Disagreement on quality, completion, etc.

### Dispute Process

1. Either party raises dispute via support/admin
2. **Work Status:** → `disputed`
3. Admin intervenes and reviews case
4. Admin resolution:
   - **Resume** → Return to previous work status
   - **Close** → Proposal Status → `closed`
   - **Force complete** → All tracks → final states

## Migration from Current Model

### Current Single Status → Three Track Model

| Current Status | Proposal Status | Payment Status | Work Status |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `pending` | `created` | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| `discussing` | `discussing` | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| `finalized` + !influencerAcceptedTerms | `discussing` | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| `finalized` + influencerAcceptedTerms + !advancePaid | `agreed` | `pending_advance` OR `pending_escrow` | `not_started` |
| `finalized` + influencerAcceptedTerms + advancePaid | `agreed` | `advance_paid` | `not_started` |
| `in_progress` + !submittedWork | `agreed` | `advance_paid` | `in_progress` |
| `in_progress` + submittedWork | `agreed` | `advance_paid` | `submitted` |
| `completed` | `agreed` | `fully_paid` | `approved` |
| `cancelled` | `cancelled` | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| `disputed` | `agreed` | `advance_paid` | `disputed` |

## Open Questions

1. **Payment flow for escrow:** Should "Release Advance" happen automatically when escrow is funded, or require promoter confirmation?

2. **Platform fee refund:** If proposal cancels after influencer pays fee but before promoter pays, do we refund the influencer?

3. **Auto-archive timeout:** Implement 7-day timeout for inactive proposals (mentioned in payment-flow.md)?

4. **Revision limits:** Should there be a maximum number of revision cycles before dispute can be raised?

5. **Overall status field:** Keep `overallStatus` as computed field for backward compatibility, or migrate all queries to use 3 tracks?
